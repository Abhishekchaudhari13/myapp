## Install

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**1)** This github repository, using ```git clone```

**2)** Using npm ```npm install reactjs-onboarding.js --save```


## Usage


reactjs-onboarding.js can be added to your project in three simple steps:



**1)** Include named imports of `Onboarding.js` and `OnboardingItem.js` in your project

```
```


```jsx
import {Onboarding} from 'reactjs-onboarding'
import {OnboardingItem} from 'reactjs-onboarding'
```


**2)** Give unique Id to the element that you want to point the arrow to. Or you can give ref to the element

```
```


```jsx

<div id="example">
 Pass the co-ordinates by id
</div>

<div ref={(e) => this.reference = e}
 Pass the co-ordinates by reference
</div>
```


**3)** In componentDidMount set `visible` parameter to true so that Onboarding gets called

```
```


```jsx
componentDidMount(){
  this.setState({visible: true})
}
```


**4)** Call Onboarding and OnboardingItem in render method using id or using refs. `name` parameter in <Onboarding> corresponds to the flag stored in the localStorage.

```
```


```jsx
<Onboarding name="example" visible={this.state.visible}>
  <OnboardingItem elementCoOrdinate="example" message="This is the onborading message 1" />
  <OnboardingItem elementCoOrdinate={this.reference} message="This is the onboarding message 2" />
  </OnboardingItem>
</Onboarding>
```
